# CosmWasm support

This package contains CosmWasm integration points.

This package provides first class support for:

* Queries
  * Denoms
  * Pools
  * Prices
* Messages / Execution
  * Mint
  * Swap

### Command line interface (CLI)

* Commands

```sh
  osmosisd tx wasm -h
```

* Query

```sh
  osmosisd query wasm -h
```

### Tests

This contains a few high level tests that `x/wasm` is properly integrated.

Since the code tested is not in this repo, and we are just testing the application
integration (app.go), I figured this is the most suitable location for it.
