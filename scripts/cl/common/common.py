# SqrtPriceRange represents a price range between the current and the next tick
# as well as the liquidity in that price range.
# When swapping token zero for one, sqrt_price_current >= sqrt_price_next.
# When swapping token one for zero, sqrt_price_current <= sqrt_price_next.
#
# sqrt_price_next can be None. When it is None, that implies that the next sqrt
# price must be calculated. In such a case, next sqrt price depends on the
# remaining amount of token in to be swapped. This occurs for the last sqrt price
# range in the collection of sqrt price ranges that represent a swap.
#
# For example, I might have a swap of 100 ETH in from 5000 to 5001 with liquidity
# X, from 5001 to 5002 with liquidity Y,
# and from 5002 to UNKNOWN with liquidity Z. In this case, the UNKNOWN
# depends on how much ETH we have remaining after consuming liquidity X and Y.
