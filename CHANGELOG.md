<!--
Guiding Principles:

Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
There should be an entry for every single version.
The same types of changes should be grouped.
Versions and sections should be linkable.
The latest version comes first.
The release date of each version is displayed.
Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

Usage:

Change log entries are to be added to the Unreleased section under the
appropriate stanza (see below). Each entry should ideally include a tag and
the Github issue reference in the following format:

* (<tag>) \#<issue-number> message

The issue numbers will later be link-ified during the release process so you do
not have to worry about including a link manually, but you can if you wish.

Types of changes (Stanzas):

"Features" for new features.
"Improvements" for changes in existing functionality.
"Deprecated" for soon-to-be removed features.
"Bug Fixes" for any bug fixes.
"Client Breaking" for breaking CLI commands and REST routes used by end-users.
"API Breaking" for breaking exported APIs used by developers building on SDK.
"State Machine Breaking" for any changes that result in a different AppState given same genesisState and txList.

# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

- [#765](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/pull/765) Fix a bug in `Makefile` regarding the location of localtestnet docker image.

## Features

- Update to Tendermint v0.34.15
- Increase p2p timeouts to alleviate p2p network breaking at epoch
- [#741](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/pull/741) Allow node operators to set a second min gas price for arbitrage txs.
- [#623](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/pull/623) Use gosec for staticly linting for common non-determinism issues in SDK applications.

- [sdk-#58](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/cosmos-sdk/pull/58) Fix a bug where recheck would not remove txs with invalid sequence numbers
- [sdk-#52](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/cosmos-sdk/pull/52) Fix inconsistencies in default pruning config, and change defaults. Fix pruning=everything defaults.
  - previously default was actually keeping 3 weeks of state, and every 100th state. (Not that far off from archive nodes)
  - pruning=default now changed to 1 week of state (100k blocks), and keep-every=0. (So a constant number of states stored)
  - pruning=everything now stores the last 10 states, to avoid db corruption errors plaguing everyone who used it. This isn't a significant change, because the pruning interval was anyways 10 blocks, so your node had to store 10 blocks of state anyway.

## [v6.0.0](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v6.0.0)

This upgrade fixes a bug in the v5.0.0 upgrade's app.go, which prevents new IBC channels from being created.
This binary is compatible with v5.0.0 until block height `2464000`, estimated to be at 4PM UTC Monday December 20th.

- [Patch](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/commit/907001b08686ed980e0afa3d97a9c5e2f095b79f#diff-a172cedcae47474b615c54d510a5d84a8dea3032e958587430b413538be3f333) - Revert back to passing in the correct staking keeper into the IBC keeper constructor.
- [Height gating change](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/ibc-go/pull/1) - Height gate the change in IBC, to make the v6.0.0 binary compatible until upgrade height.
