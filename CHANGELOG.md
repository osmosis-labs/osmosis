Guiding Principles:

Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
There should be an entry for every single version.
The same types of changes should be grouped.
Versions and sections should be linkable.
The latest version comes first.
The release date of each version is displayed.
Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

Usage:

Change log entries are to be added to the Unreleased section under the
appropriate stanza (see below). Each entry should ideally include a tag and
the Github issue reference in the following format:

* (<tag>) \#<issue-number> message

The issue numbers will later be link-ified during the release process so you do
not have to worry about including a link manually, but you can if you wish.

Types of changes (Stanzas):

"Features" for new features.
"Improvements" for changes in existing functionality.
"Deprecated" for soon-to-be removed features.
"Bug Fixes" for any bug fixes.
"Client Breaking" for breaking CLI commands and REST routes used by end-users.
"API Breaking" for breaking exported APIs used by developers building on SDK.
"State Machine Breaking" for any changes that result in a different AppState 
given same genesisState and txList.

The Nitrogen release brings with it a number of features enabling further cosmwasm development work in Osmosis.
It including breaking changes to the GAMM API's, many developer and node operator improvements for Cosmwasm & IBC, along with new txfee and governance features. In addition to various bug fixes and code quality improvements.

#### GAMM API changes

API changes were done to enable more CFMM's to be implemented within the existing framework.
Integrators will have to update their messages and queries to adapt, please see https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/x/gamm/breaking_changes_notes.md

#### Cosmwasm

Upgrade from wasmd v0.23.x to [v0.27.0](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/releases/tag/v0.27.0). This has the following features:
  * State sync now works for cosmwasm state
  * Cosmwasm builds on M1 macs
  * Many security fixes

The TokenFactory module is added to the chain, making it possible for users and contracts to make new native tokens.

## [v8.0.0 - Emergency proposals upgrade](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v8.0.0)

This upgrade is a patch that must be hard forked in, as on-chain governance of Osmosis approved proposal [227](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/227) and proposal [228](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/228).

This upgrade includes:

* Adding height-gated AnteHandler message filter to filter unpooling tx pre-upgrade.
* At block height 4402000 accelerates prop 225, which in turn moves incentives from certain pools according to props 222-224
* Adds a msg allowing unpooling of UST pools. 
  * This procedure is initiated by whitelisting pools 560, 562, 567, 578, 592, 610, 612, 615, 642, 679, 580, 635. 
  * Unpooling allows exiting whitelisted pools directly, finish unbonding duration with the exited tokens instead of having to wait unbonding duration to swap LP shares back to collaterals. 
  * This procedure also includes locks that were already unbonding pre-upgrade and locks that were superfluid delegated.

Every node should upgrade their software version to v8.0.0 before the upgrade block height 4402000. If you use cosmovisor, simply swap out the binary at upgrades/v7/bin to be v8.0.0, and restart the node. Do check cosmovisor version returns v8.0.0

## [v7.0.2 - Carbon](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v7.0.2)

This release fixes an instance of undefined behaviour present in v7.0.0.
Parts of the code use a function called [`ApplyFuncIfNoErr`]() whose purpose is to catch errors, and if found undo state updates during its execution.
It is intended to also catch panics and undo the problematic code's execution.
Right now a panic in this code block would halt the node, as it would not know how to proceed.
(But no state change would be committed)

## [v7.0.0 - Carbon](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v7.0.0)

The Osmosis Carbon Release! The changes are primarily

The large features include:

* Superfluid Staking - Allowing LP shares be staked to help secure the network
* Adding permissioned cosmwasm to the chain
* IAVL speedups, greatly improving epoch and query performance
* Local mempool filters to charge higher gas for arbitrage txs
* Allow partial unlocking of non-superfluid'd locks

Upgrade instructions for node operators can be found [here](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/networks/osmosis-1/upgrades/v7/guide.md)

### SDK fork updates

* [sdk-#52](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/cosmos-sdk/pull/52) Fix inconsistencies in default pruning config, and change defaults. Fix pruning=everything defaults.
  * previously default was actually keeping 3 weeks of state, and every 100th state. (Not that far off from archive nodes)
  * pruning=default now changed to 1 week of state (100k blocks), and keep-every=0. (So a constant number of states stored)
  * pruning=everything now stores the last 10 states, to avoid db corruption errors plaguing everyone who used it. This isn't a significant change, because the pruning interval was anyways 10 blocks, so your node had to store 10 blocks of state anyway.

This binary is compatible with v5.0.0 until block height `2464000`, estimated to be at 4PM UTC Monday December 20th.

* [Patch](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/commit/907001b08686ed980e0afa3d97a9c5e2f095b79f#diff-a172cedcae47474b615c54d510a5d84a8dea3032e958587430b413538be3f333) - Revert back to passing in the correct staking keeper into the IBC keeper constructor.
* [Height gating change](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/ibc-go/pull/1) - Height gate the change in IBC, to make the v6.0.0 binary compatible until upgrade height.
