Guiding Principles:

Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
There should be an entry for every single version.
The same types of changes should be grouped.
Versions and sections should be linkable.
The latest version comes first.
The release date of each version is displayed.
Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

Usage:

Change log entries are to be added to the Unreleased section under the
appropriate stanza (see below). Each entry should ideally include a tag and
the Github issue reference in the following format:

* (<tag>) \#<issue-number> message

The issue numbers will later be link-ified during the release process so you do
not have to worry about including a link manually, but you can if you wish.

Types of changes (Stanzas):

"Features" for new features.
"Improvements" for changes in existing functionality.
"Deprecated" for soon-to-be removed features.
"Bug Fixes" for any bug fixes.
"Client Breaking" for breaking CLI commands and REST routes used by end-users.
"API Breaking" for breaking exported APIs used by developers building on SDK.
"State Machine Breaking" for any changes that result in a different AppState given same genesisState and txList.

## [v7.0.2 - Carbon](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v7.0.2)

This release fixes an instance of undefined behaviour present in v7.0.0.
Parts of the code use a function called [`ApplyFuncIfNoErr`]() whose purpose is to catch errors, and if found undo state updates during its execution.
It is intended to also catch panics and undo the problematic code's execution.
Right now a panic in this code block would halt the node, as it would not know how to proceed.
(But no state change would be committed)

## [v7.0.0 - Carbon](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v7.0.0)

The Osmosis Carbon Release! The changes are primarily

The large features include:

* Superfluid Staking - Allowing LP shares be staked to help secure the network
* Adding permissioned cosmwasm to the chain
* IAVL speedups, greatly improving epoch and query performance
* Local mempool filters to charge higher gas for arbitrage txs
* Allow partial unlocking of non-superfluid'd locks

Upgrade instructions for node operators can be found [here](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/networks/osmosis-1/upgrades/v7/guide.md)

### SDK fork updates

* [sdk-#52](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/cosmos-sdk/pull/52) Fix inconsistencies in default pruning config, and change defaults. Fix pruning=everything defaults.
