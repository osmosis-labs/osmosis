<!--
Guiding Principles:

Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
There should be an entry for every single version.
The same types of changes should be grouped.
Versions and sections should be linkable.
The latest version comes first.
The release date of each version is displayed.
Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

Usage:

Change log entries are to be added to the Unreleased section under the
appropriate stanza (see below). Each entry should ideally include a tag and
the Github issue reference in the following format:

* (<tag>) \#<issue-number> message

The issue numbers will later be link-ified during the release process so you do
not have to worry about including a link manually, but you can if you wish.

Types of changes (Stanzas):

"Features" for new features.
"Improvements" for changes in existing functionality.
"Deprecated" for soon-to-be removed features.
"Bug Fixes" for any bug fixes.
"Client Breaking" for breaking CLI commands and REST routes used by end-users.
"API Breaking" for breaking exported APIs used by developers building on SDK.
"State Machine Breaking" for any changes that result in a different AppState
given same genesisState and txList.

## v16.0.0
Osmosis Labs is excited to announce the release of v16.0.0, a major upgrade that includes a number of new features and improvements like introduction of new modules, updates existing APIs, and dependency updates. This upgrade aims to enhance capital efficiency by introducing SuperCharged Liquidity, introduce custom liquidity pools backed by CosmWasm smart contracts, and improve overall functionality.

New Modules and Features:

SuperCharged Liquidity Module (x/concentrated-liquidity):
- Introduces a game-changing pool model that enhances captical efficiency in Osmosis.

CosmWasm Pool Module (x/cosmwasmpool):
- Enables the creation and management of liquidity pools backed by CosmWasm smart contracts.

ProtoRev Changes (x/protorev):
- Modifies the payment schedule for the dev account from weekly to after every trade.
- Triggers backruns, joinPool, and exitPool using hooks.

TokenFactory before send hooks (x/tokenfactory):
- This enhancement allows for executing custom logic before sending tokens, providing more flexibility
and control over token transfers.

## v15.0.0

This release containts the following new modules:
- ProtoRev module (x/protorev). This module captures MEV via in-protocol cyclic arbitrage and distributes the revenue back to the protocol based on governance. Developed by the Skip team.

  - This work is importable by external repositories, intended as an ecosystem standards
- Downtime detection tooling
  - There is now an on-chain query, allowing you to test if the chain is recovering from a downtime of a given duration.
    - The querier defines what recovering means, e.g. for a 1 hour downtime, do you consider the chain as recovering until at least 10 minutes since last 1 hr downtime? 
- Geometric TWAP
  - Every AMM pool now exposes a geometric TWAP, in addition to the existing arithmetic TWAP

  * Introduction of the stableswap pool type
  * Multi-hop spread factor reduction
  * Filtered queries to help front-ends
  * Adding a spot price v2 query
    * spotprice v1beta1 had baseassetdenom and quoteassetdenom backwards.
    * All contracts and integrators should switch to the v2 query from now on.
  * Adding more queries for contract developers
  * Force unpooling is now enableable by governance
* IBC features
  * Upgrade to IBC v3.4.0
  * Added IBC rate limiting, to increase safety of bridged assets
  * Allow ICS-20 to call into cosmwasm contracts
* Cosmwasm
  * Upgrade to cosmwasm v0.29.x
  * Inclusion of requested queries for contract developers

### Features

  - This PR adds v2 queries for doing the correct thing, and giving people time to migrate from v1beta1 queries to v2.
  - It also changes cosmwasm to only allow the v2 queries, as no contracts on Osmosis mainnet uses the v1beta1 queries.

#### Txfees

[#1145](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/pull/1145) Non-osmo txfees now get swapped into osmo everyday at epoch, and then distributed to stakers.

#### Cosmwasm

Upgrade from wasmd v0.23.x to [v0.27.0](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/releases/tag/v0.27.0). This has the following features:
  * State sync now works for cosmwasm state
  * Cosmwasm builds on M1 macs
  * Many security fixes

The TokenFactory module is added to the chain, making it possible for users and contracts to make new native tokens.
Cosmwasm bindings have been added, to make swapping and creating these new tokens easier within the contract ecosystem.

## [v8.0.0 - Emergency proposals upgrade](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v8.0.0)

This upgrade is a patch that must be hard forked in, as on-chain governance of Osmosis approved proposal [227](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/227) and proposal [228](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/228).

This upgrade includes:

* Adding height-gated AnteHandler message filter to filter unpooling tx pre-upgrade.
* At block height 4402000 accelerates prop 225, which in turn moves incentives from certain pools according to props 222-224
* Adds a msg allowing unpooling of UST pools. 
  * This procedure is initiated by whitelisting pools 560, 562, 567, 578, 592, 610, 612, 615, 642, 679, 580, 635. 
  * Unpooling allows exiting whitelisted pools directly, finish unbonding duration with the exited tokens instead of having to wait unbonding duration to swap LP shares back to collaterals. 
  * This procedure also includes locks that were already unbonding pre-upgrade and locks that were superfluid delegated.

Every node should upgrade their software version to v8.0.0 before the upgrade block height 4402000. If you use cosmovisor, simply swap out the binary at upgrades/v7/bin to be v8.0.0, and restart the node. Do check cosmovisor version returns v8.0.0

## [v7.0.2 - Carbon](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v7.0.2)

This release fixes an instance of undefined behaviour present in v7.0.0.
Parts of the code use a function called [`ApplyFuncIfNoErr`]() whose purpose is to catch errors, and if found undo state updates during its execution.
It is intended to also catch panics and undo the problematic code's execution.
Right now a panic in this code block would halt the node, as it would not know how to proceed.
(But no state change would be committed)

## [v7.0.0 - Carbon](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/releases/tag/v7.0.0)

The Osmosis Carbon Release! The changes are primarily

The large features include:

* Superfluid Staking - Allowing LP shares be staked to help secure the network
* Adding permissioned cosmwasm to the chain
* IAVL speedups, greatly improving epoch and query performance
* Local mempool filters to charge higher gas for arbitrage txs
* Allow partial unlocking of non-superfluid'd locks

Upgrade instructions for node operators can be found [here](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/networks/osmosis-1/upgrades/v7/guide.md)

### SDK fork updates

* [sdk-#52](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/cosmos-sdk/pull/52) Fix inconsistencies in default pruning config, and change defaults. Fix pruning=everything defaults.
