# Sidecar Query Server Ingester

This is an implementation of the sidecar query server (SQS) ingester.

Please find the sidecar query server [here](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/sqs)

SQS is meant to offload the query load from the chain node to a separate server. Primarily, we use it for swap routing.
