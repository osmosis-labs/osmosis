# Introduction to Osmosis

Osmosis is a fair-launched, customizable automated market maker for
interchain assets that allows the creation and management of
non-custodial, self-balancing, interchain token index similar to one of
Balancer.

Inspired by [Balancer](https://balancer.gitbook.io/balancer-v2/v1) and Sunny
Aggarwal's '[DAOfying Uniswap Automated Market Maker
Pools](https://www.sunnya97.com/blog/daoifying-uniswap-automated-market-maker-pools)',
the goal for Osmosis is to provide the best-in-class tools that extend
the use of AMMs within the Cosmos ecosystem beyond traditional token
swap-type use cases. Bonding curves, while have found its primary use
case in decentralized exchange mechanisms, its potential use case can be
further extended through the customizability that Osmosis offers.
Through the customizability offered by Osmosis such as custom-curve AMMs,
dynamic adjustments of spread factors, multi-token liquidity pools--the AMM
can offer decentralized formation of token fundraisers, interchain
staking, options market, and more for the Cosmos ecosystem.

Whereas most Cosmos zones have focused their incentive scheme on the
delegators, Osmosis attempts to align the interests of multiple
stakeholders of the ecosystem such as LPs, DAO members, as well as
delegators. One mechanism that is introduced is how staked liquidity
providers have sovereign ownership over their pools, and through the
pool governance process allow them to adjust the parameters depending on
the pool's competition and market conditions. Osmosis is a sovereign
Cosmos zone that derives its sovereignty not only from its
application-specific blockchain architecture but also the collective
sovereignty of the LPs that has aligned interest to different tokens
that they are providing liquidity for.
