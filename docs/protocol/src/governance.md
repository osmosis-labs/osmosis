# Governance

Osmosis is a sovereign delegated Proof-of-Stake chain with its own validator set.
Users delegate their stake to validators to secure the network while keeping the
opportunity to overwrite validator's decision with their own vote.

The decisions are made through the governance process consisting of proposals.

A proposal can be created by anyone. Once created with the required deposit, the
voting period begins.

The proposal is either accepted or rejected.

There are two types of proposals that determine the length of the voting period,
deposit amount and quorum:
1. Standard proposal
2. Expedited proposal
