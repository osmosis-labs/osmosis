Input a quantity of one of the assets. The quantity of the other asset(s) will auto-complete. (Pools require assets to be deposited in pre-determined weights.)

Please note that simply adding liquidity will not give you rewards. In order to get rewards you must bond LP tokens. 
:::

To remove liquidity, input the percentage amount to withdraw.

![](../../assets/remove-liquidity.png)

Incentivized pools receive OSMO liquidity mining rewards. Rewards are distributed to bonded LP tokens in these pools that meeting the bonding length criteria.

## Bonding LP Tokens
 Start Earning! Users can choose to bond their LP tokens after depositing liquidity. LP tokens remain bonded for a length of their time of their choosing. Bonded LP tokens are eligible for liquidity mining rewards if they meet the minimum bonding length requirement.

Click Start Earning and choose a bonding length.

![](../../assets/start-earning.png)

When a user wants to stop bonding an LP token, they submit a transaction that begins the unbonding period. After the end of the timer, they can submit another transaction to withdraw the tokens.




## Create a New Pool

Creating pools in Osmosis is permissionless, meaning any user can create a pool with two or more supported assets.
Go to Pools > Create a Pool. Select from your wallet the assets that will comprise the pool. Choose a weight for each asset.

![](../../assets/creating-pool.png)

Choose a quantity of each asset to deposit into the pool.

Input a swap fee for the pool. (An explanation of swap fees can be found [here](/overview/terminology.html#fees).)

Click Create a Pool and voil√†! The pool is launched. The parameters chosen when creating the pool (token weights, swap fees) cannot be changed later.
