## Concepts

The `x/gamm` module implements an AMM using Balancer style pools with
varying amounts and weights of assets in pools.

### Pool

#### Creation of Pool

At an initial creation of the pool, a fixed amount of 100 share token is
minted in the pool and sent to the creator of the pool's account. The
pool share denom is in the format of `gamm/pool/{poolID}` and is
displayed in the format of `GAMM-{poolID}` to the user. Pool assets are
sorted in alphabetical order by default.

#### Joining Pool

When joining a pool, a user provides the maximum amount of tokens
they're willing to deposit, while the front end takes care of the
calculation of how many share tokens the user is eligible for at the
specific moment of sending the transaction.

Calculation of exactly how many tokens are needed to get the designated
share is done at the moment of processing the transaction, validating
that it does not exceed the maximum amount of tokens the user is willing
to deposit. After the validation, GAMM share tokens of the pool are
minted and sent to the user's account. Joining the pool using a single
asset is also possible.

#### Exiting Pool

When exiting a pool, the user provides the minimum amount of tokens they
are willing to receive as they are returning their shares of the pool.
However, unlike joining a pool, exiting a pool requires the user to pay
the exit fee, which is set as a param of the pool. The user's share
tokens burnt as result. Exiting the pool using a single asset is also
possible.

[Exiting pool](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/x/gamm/keeper/pool_service.go)

### Swap

During the process of swapping a specific asset, the token the user is
putting into the pool is denoted as `tokenIn`, while the token that
would be returned to the user, the asset that is being swapped for,
after the swap is denoted as `tokenOut` throughout the module.

Given a `tokenIn`, the following calculations are done to calculate how
many tokens are to be swapped into and removed from the pool:

`tokenBalanceOut * [1 - { tokenBalanceIn / (tokenBalanceIn + (1 - swapFee) * tokenAmountIn)} ^ (tokenWeightIn / tokenWeightOut)]`

The calculation is also able to be reversed, the case where user
provides `tokenOut`. The calculation for the amount of tokens that the
user should be putting in is done through the following formula:

`tokenBalanceIn * [{tokenBalanceOut / (tokenBalanceOut - tokenAmountOut)} ^ (tokenWeightOut / tokenWeightIn) -1] / tokenAmountIn`

#### Spot Price

Meanwhile, calculation of the spot price with a swap fee is done using
the following formula:

`spotPrice / (1 - swapFee)`, where `spotPrice` is defined as:

`(tokenBalanceIn / tokenWeightIn) / (tokenBalanceOut / tokenWeightOut)`

[Spot price](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/x/gamm/keeper/swap.go)

#### Multi-Hop

All tokens are swapped using a multi-hop mechanism. That is, all swaps
are routed via the most cost-efficient way, swapping in and out from
multiple pools in the process.

When a trade consists of just two OSMO-included routes during a single transaction,
the swap fees on each hop would be automatically halved. 
Example: for converting `ATOM -> OSMO -> LUNA` using two pools with swap fees `0.3% + 0.2%`,
instead `0.15% + 0.1%` fees will be aplied. 

[Multi-Hop](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/main/x/gamm/keeper/multihop.go)

## Weights

Weights refer to the how we weight the reserves of assets within a pool.
Its often convenient to think of weights in terms of ratios, so a 1:1
pool between "ATOM" and "BTC" is a pool where the spot price is
`#ATOM in pool / #BTC in pool`.

A 2:1 pool is one where the spot price is
`2*(#ATOM in pool) / #BTC in pool`. This weights allows one to get the
same spot price in the pool, with fewer ATOM reserves. (This comes at
the cost of having higher slippage, e.g.Â buying 10 atoms moves the price
more than a 1:1 pool with the same BTC liquidity).

Within the state machine, we represent weights as numbers, and the
ratios are computed internally. So you could specify a pool between
three assets, with weights 100:30:50, which is equivalent to a 10:3:5
pool.

The ratios provided in a CreatePool message, or governance proposal are
capped at 2\^20. However, within the state machine they are stored with
an extra 30 bits of precision, allowing for smooth changes between two
weights to happen with sufficient granularity.

(Note, these docs are intended to get shuffled around as we write more
of the spec for x/gamm. I just wanted to document this along with the
PR, to save work for our future selves)

## Network Parameters

Pools have the following parameters:

|  Key                       | Type                        |
|  --------------------------| ----------------------------|
|  SwapFee                   | sdk.Dec                     |
|  ExitFee                   | sdk.Dec                     |
|  FutureGovernor            | \*FutureGovernor            |
|  Weights                   | \*Weights                   |
|  SmoothWeightChangeParams  | \*SmoothWeightChangeParams  |
|  PoolCreationFee           | sdk.Coins                   |

1. **SwapFee** -
    The swap fee is the cut of all swaps that goes to the Liquidity Providers (LPs) for a pool. Suppose a pool has a swap fee `s`. Then if a user wants to swap `T` tokens in the pool, `sT` tokens go to the LP's, and then `(1 - s)T` tokens are swapped according to the AMM swap function.
2. **ExitFee** -
    The exit fee is a fee that is applied to LP's that want to remove their liquidity from the pool. Suppose a pool has an exit fee `e`. If they currently have `S` LP shares, then when they remove their liquidity they get tokens worth `(1 - e)S` shares back. The remaining `eS` shares are then burned, and the tokens corresponding to these shares are kept as liquidity.
3. **FutureGovernor** -
    Osmosis plans to allow every pool to act as a DAO, with its own governance in a future upgrade. To facilitate this transition, we allow pools to specify who the governor should be as a string. There are currently 3 options for the future governor.
    - No one will govern it. This is done by leaving the future governor string as blank.
    - Allow a given address to govern it. This is done by setting the future governor as a bech32 address.
    - Lockups to a token. This is the full DAO scenario. The future governor specifies a token denomination `denom`, and a lockup duration `duration`. This says that "all tokens of denomination `denom` that are locked up for `duration` or longer, have equal say in governance of this pool".
4. **Weights** -
    This defines the weights of the pool - [https://balancer.fi/whitepaper.pdf](https://balancer.fi/whitepaper.pdf)
5. **SmoothWeightChangeParams** -
    This allows pool governance to smoothly change the weights of the assets it holds in the pool. So it can slowly move from a 2:1 ratio, to a 1:1 ratio.
    Currently, smooth weight changes are implemented as a linear change in weight ratios over a given duration of time. So weights changed from 4:1 to 2:2 over 2 days, then at day 1 of the change, the weights would be 3:1.5, and at day 2 its 2:2, and will remain at these weight ratios.

The GAMM module also has a **PoolCreationFee** parameter, which currently is set to `100000000 uosmo` or `100 OSMO`.

Add liquidity to a specified pool with only one of the required assets (i.e. Join pool 1 (50/50 ATOM-OSMO) with just ATOM).

This command essentially swaps an **exact** amount of an asset for the required pairing and then converts the pair to a **minimum** of the requested LP shares in a single step (i.e. combines the `swap-exact-amount-in` and `join-pool` commands)

```sh
osmosisd tx gamm join-swap-extern-amount-in [token-in] [share-out-min-amount] --from --pool-id --chain-id

```

:::

### Exit-swap-extern-amount-out

Remove liquidity from a specified pool with a **maximum** amount of LP shares and swap to an **exact** amount of one of the token pairs (i.e. Leave pool 1 (50/50 ATOM-OSMO) and receive 100% ATOM instead of 50% OSMO and 50% ATOM).

This command essentially converts an LP share into the corresponding share of tokens and then swaps to the specified `token-out` in a single step (i.e. combines the `swap-exact-amount-out` and `exit-pool` commands)

```sh
osmosisd tx gamm exit-swap-extern-amount-out [token-out] [share-in-max-amount] --pool-id --from --chain-id
```

::: details Example

Exit `pool 3` by removing a **maximum** of `3.408979387886193586 gamm/pool/3` and swap the `OSMO` portion of the LP share to receive 100% AKT in the **exact** amount of `0.199430 AKT`:
