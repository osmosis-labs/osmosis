# Pool Parameters

The `x/gamm` module contains the following `Pool` parameters:

| Key                      | Type                      |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| SwapFee                  | sdk.Dec                   |
| ExitFee                  | sdk.Dec                   |
| SmoothWeightChangeParams | *SmoothWeightChangeParams |

- `SwapFee`: The swap fee is the cut of all swaps that goes to the Liquidity
  Providers (LPs) for a pool. Suppose a pool has a swap fee `sf`. Then if a user
  wants to swap `T` tokens in the pool, `sf * T` tokens go to the LP's, and then
  `(1 - sf) * T` tokens are swapped according to the AMM swap function.
- `ExitFee`: The exit fee is a fee that is applied to LP's that want to remove
  their liquidity from the pool. Suppose a pool has an exit fee `ef`. If they
  currently have `S` LP shares, then when they remove their liquidity they get
  tokens worth `(1 - ef) * S` shares back. The remaining `ef * S` shares are
  then burned, and the tokens corresponding to these shares are kept as liquidity.
- `SmoothWeightChangeParams`: These params allows pool governance to smoothly
  change the weights of the assets it holds in the pool. E.g. it can slowly move
  from a 2:1 ratio, to a 1:1 ratio. The params consist of `StartTime`, `Duration`,
  `InitialPoolWeights` and `TargetPoolWeights`, where the latter two params are
  a list of `PoolAsset` that define the `Token` and `Weight`. Currently, smooth
  weight changes are implemented as a linear change in weight ratios over a given
  duration of time. So weights changed from 4:1 to 2:2 over 2 days, then at day
  1 of the change, the weights would be 3:1.5, and at day 2 its 2:2, and will
  remain at these weight ratios.
