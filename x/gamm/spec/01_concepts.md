# Concepts

The `x/gamm` module implements an AMM using Balancer style pools with varying
amounts and weights of assets in pools.

## Pool

### Creation of Pool

At an initial creation of the pool, a fixed amount of 100 share token is minted
in the pool and sent to the creator of the pool's account. The pool share denom
is in the format of `gamm/pool/{poolID}` and is displayed in the format of `GAMM-{poolID}`
to the user. Pool assets are sorted in alphabetical order by default.

### Joining Pool

When joining a pool, a user provides the maximum amount of tokens they're willing
to deposit, while the front end takes care of the calculation of how many share
tokens the user is eligible for at the specific moment of sending the transaction.

Calculation of exactly how many tokens are needed to get the designated share is
done at the moment of processing the transaction, validating that it does not
exceed the maximum amount of tokens the user is willing to deposit. After the
validation, GAMM share tokens of the pool are minted and sent to the user's account.
Joining the pool using a single asset is also possible.

### Exiting Pool

When exiting a pool, the user provides the minimum amount of tokens they are
willing to receive as they are returning their shares of the pool. However,
unlike joining a pool, exiting a pool requires the user to pay the exit fee,
which is set as a param of the pool. The user's share tokens burnt as result.
Exiting the pool using a single asset is also possible.

## Swap

During the process of swapping a specific asset, the token the user is putting
into the pool is denoted as `tokenIn`, while the token that would be returned to
the user, the asset that is being swapped for, after the swap is denoted as
`tokenOut` throughout the module.

Given a `tokenIn`, the following calculations are done to calculate how many
tokens are to be swapped into and removed from the pool:

`tokenBalanceOut * [1 - { tokenBalanceIn / (tokenBalanceIn + (1 - swapFee) * tokenAmountIn)} ^ (tokenWeightIn / tokenWeightOut)]`

The calculation is also able to be reversed, the case where user provides `tokenOut`.
The calculation for the amount of tokens that the user should be putting in is
done through the following formula:

`tokenBalanceIn * [{tokenBalanceOut / (tokenBalanceOut - tokenAmountOut)} ^ (tokenWeightOut / tokenWeightIn) -1] / tokenAmountIn`

### Spot Price

Meanwhile, calculation of the spot price with a swap fee is done using the following
formula:

`spotPrice / (1 - swapFee)`, where `spotPrice` is defined as:

`(tokenBalanceIn / tokenWeightIn) / (tokenBalanceOut / tokenWeightOut)`

### Multi-Hop

All tokens are swapped using a multi-hop mechanism. That is, all swaps are routed
via the most cost-efficient way, swapping in and out from multiple pools in the
process.
