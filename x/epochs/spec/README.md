# Epochs

## Abstract

Often in the SDK, we would like to run certain code every-so often. The
purpose of `epochs` module is to allow other modules to set that they
would like to be signaled once every period. So another module can
specify it wants to execute code once a week, starting at UTC-time = x.
`epochs` creates a generalized epoch interface to other modules so that
they can easily be signalled upon such events.

## Queries

### epoch-infos

Query the currently running epochInfos

```sh
osmosisd query epochs epoch-infos
```
::: details Example

An example output:

```sh
epochs:
- current_epoch: "183"
  current_epoch_start_height: "2438409"
  current_epoch_start_time: "2021-12-18T17:16:09.898160996Z"
  duration: 86400s
  epoch_counting_started: true
  identifier: day
  start_time: "2021-06-18T17:00:00Z"
- current_epoch: "26"
  current_epoch_start_height: "2424854"
  current_epoch_start_time: "2021-12-17T17:02:07.229632445Z"
  duration: 604800s
  epoch_counting_started: true
  identifier: week
  start_time: "2021-06-18T17:00:00Z"
```
:::

### current-epoch

Query the current epoch by the specified identifier

```sh
osmosisd query epochs current-epoch [identifier]
```

::: details Example

Query the current `day` epoch:

```sh
osmosisd query epochs current-epoch day
```

Which in this example outputs:

```sh
current_epoch: "183"
```
