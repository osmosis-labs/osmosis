# Concepts

The purpose of `incentives` module is to provide incentives to the users who lock specific token for specific period of time.

Locking token could be LP token or native tokens, the incentive amount is entered from the provider directly via a specific message type.
Rewards for a given pool of locked up tokens are pooled into a pot until the disbursement time. At the disbursement time, they are distributed pro-rata to members of the pool.
