/*
   This is the logic for the Osmosis implementation for EIP-1559 fee market,
	 the goal of this code is to prevent spam by charging more for transactions when the network is busy.

	 This logic does two things:
   - Maintaining data parsed from chain transaction execution and updating eipState accordingly.
   - Resetting eipState to default every ResetInterval (6000) block height intervals to maintain consistency.

   Additionally:
   - Periodically evaluating CheckTx and RecheckTx for compliance with these parameters.

   Note: The reset interval is set to 6000 blocks, which is approximately 8.5 hours.

   Challenges:
   - Transactions falling under their gas bounds are currently discarded by nodes. This behavior can be modified for CheckTx, rather than RecheckTx.

   Global variables stored in memory:
   - DefaultBaseFee: Default base fee, initialized to 0.005.
   - MinBaseFee: Minimum base fee, initialized to 0.0025.
   - MaxBaseFee: Maximum base fee, initialized to 5.
   - MaxBlockChangeRate: The maximum block change rate, initialized to 1/10.

   Global constants:
   - TargetGas: Gas wanted per block, initialized to .625 * block_gas_limt = 187.5 million.
   - ResetInterval: The interval at which eipState is reset, initialized to 6000 blocks.
   - BackupFile: File for backup, set to "eip1559state.json".
   - RecheckFeeConstant: A constant value for rechecking fees, initialized to 2.25.

	// N.B. on the reason for having two base fee constants for high and low fees:
	//
	// At higher base fees, we apply a smaller re-check factor.
	// The reason for this is that the recheck factor forces the base fee to get at minimum
	// "recheck factor" times higher than the spam rate. This leads to slow recovery
	// and a bad UX for user transactions. We aim for spam to start getting evicted from the mempool
	// sooner as to avoid more severe UX degradation for user transactions. Therefore,
	// we apply a smaller recheck factor at higher base fees.
	//
	// For low base fees:
	// In face of continuous spam, will take ~19 blocks from base fee > spam cost, to mempool eviction
	// ceil(log_{1.06}(RecheckFeeConstantLowBaseFee)) (assuming base fee not going over threshold)
