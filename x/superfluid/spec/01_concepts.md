# Concepts

## SyntheticLockups
SyntheticLockups are synthetica of PeriodLocks, but different in the sense that they store suffix, which is a combination of bonding/unbonding status + validator address. This is mainly used to track whether an individual lock that has been superfluid staked has an bonding status or a unbonding status from the staking delegations.

## Intermediary Account
Intermediary Accounts establishes the connections between the superfluid staked locks and delegations to the validator. Intermediary accounts exists for every denom + validator combination, so that it would group locks with the same denom + validator selection. Superfluid staking a lock would mint spot price equivalent amount of OSMO of the lock and send it to the intermediary account and the intermediarry accounts would be delegating to the specified validator. 

## Intermediary Account Connection
Intermediary Accounts Connection serves the role of tracking the locks that an Intermediary Account is dedicated to.

Lets fill out this spec, and think about the entire state machine.

Its a state machine which has inputs:

* Epoch
* Slashes
* Gov props to add/remove superfluid assets
* ??? Staking weight changes? (Validators going inactive)

It has state:

* Superfluid assets
* Intermediary Accounts
* Dedicated Gauges
* Synthetic Locks
* Historical osmo equivalent twaps?
