// swapStrategy defines the interface for computing a swap.

// - zeroForOneStrategy to provide implementations when swapping token 0 for token 1.
// - oneForZeroStrategy to provide implementations when swapping token 1 for token 0.

	GetSqrtTargetPrice(nextTickSqrtPrice sdk.Dec) sdk.Dec
	// ComputeSwapStepOutGivenIn calculates the next sqrt price, the amount of token in consumed, the amount out to return to the user, and total fee charge on token in.
	// Parameters:
	//   * sqrtPriceCurrent is the current sqrt price.
	//   * sqrtPriceTarget is the target sqrt price computed with GetSqrtTargetPrice(). It must be one of:
	//       - Next tick sqrt price.
	//       - Sqrt price limit representing price impact protection.
	//   * liquidity is the amount of liquidity between the sqrt price current and sqrt price target.
	//   * amountRemainingIn is the amount of token in remaining to be swapped. This amount is fully consumed
	//   if sqrt price target is not reached. In that case, the returned amountInConsumed is the amount remaining given.
	//   Otherwise, the returned amountInConsumed will be smaller than amountRemainingIn given.
	// Returns:
	//   * sqrtPriceNext is the next sqrt price. It equals sqrt price target if target is reached. Otherwise, it is in-between sqrt price current and target.
	//   * amountInConsumed is the amount of token in consumed. It equals amountRemainingIn if target is reached. Otherwise, it is less than amountRemainingIn.
	//   * amountOutComputed is the amount of token out computed. It is the amount of token out to return to the user.
	//   * feeChargeTotal is the total fee charge. The fee is charged on the amount of token in.
	// See oneForZeroStrategy or zeroForOneStrategy for implementation details.

	//   * sqrtPriceTarget is the target sqrt price computed with GetSqrtTargetPrice(). It must be one of:
	//       - Next tick sqrt price.

	//   * liquidity is the amount of liquidity between the sqrt price current and sqrt price target.
	//   * amountRemainingOut is the amount of token out remaining to be swapped to estimate how much of token in is needed to be charged.
	//   This amount is fully consumed if sqrt price target is not reached. In that case, the returned amountOutConsumed is the amount remaining given.
	//   Otherwise, the returned amountOutConsumed will be smaller than amountRemainingOut given.
	// Returns:
	//   * sqrtPriceNext is the next sqrt price. It equals sqrt price target if target is reached. Otherwise, it is in-between sqrt price current and target.
	//   * amountOutConsumed is the amount of token out consumed. It equals amountRemainingOut if target is reached. Otherwise, it is less than amountRemainingOut.
	//   * amountInComputed is the amount of token in computed. It is the amount of token in to charge to the user for the desired amount out.
	//   * feeChargeTotal is the total fee charge. The fee is charged on the amount of token in.
