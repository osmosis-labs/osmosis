	// recalculation might lead to a slightly greater amount than remaining due to sqrtPriceNext having been rounded in
	// the opposite direction of the sqrtPriceCurrent. Therefore, we force the amountOut consumed to equal to amountRemaining.
	// This is acceptable since the former is calculated from the latter, and the only possible source of difference is rounding.
