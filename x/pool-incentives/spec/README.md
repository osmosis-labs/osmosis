# Pool Incentives

The `pool-incentives` module is separate but related to the `incentives` module. When a pool is created using the `GAMM` module, the `pool-incentives` module automatically creates individual gauges in the `incentives` module for every lock duration that exists in that pool. The `pool-incentives` module also takes takes the `pool_incentives` distributed from the `gov` module and distributes it to the various incentivized gauges.

## Abstract
The `pool-incentives` module is separate but related to the `incentives` module. When a pool is created using the `GAMM` module, the `pool-incentives` module automatically creates individual gauges in the `incentives` module for every lock duration that exists in that pool. The `pool-incentives` module also takes takes the `pool_incentives` distributed from the `gov` module and distributes it to the various incentivized gauges.

### replace-pool-incentives 

```sh
osmosisd tx poolincentives replace-pool-incentives [gaugeIds] [weights] [flags]
```

::: details Example 

Fully replace records for pool incentives:

```bash
osmosisd tx poolincentives replace-pool-incentives proposal.json --from --chain-id
```

The proposal.json would look as follows:

```json
{
  "title": "Pool Incentive Adjustment",
  "description": "Adjust pool incentives",
  "records": [
    {
      "gauge_id": "0",
      "weight": "100000"
    },
    {
      "gauge_id": "1",
      "weight": "1766249"
    },
    {
      "gauge_id": "XXX",
      "weight": "XXXXXXXX"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### update-pool-incentives  

Update the weight of specified pool gauges in regards to their share of incentives (by creating a proposal)

```sh
osmosisd tx poolincentives update-pool-incentives [gaugeIds] [weights] [flags] --from --chain-id
```

::: details Example

Update the pool incentives for `gauge_id` 0 and 1:

```bash
osmosisd tx gov submit-proposal update-pool-incentives proposal.json --from WALLET_NAME --chain-id CHAIN_ID
```

The proposal.json would look as follows:

```json
{
  "title": "Pool Incentive Adjustment",
  "description": "Adjust pool incentives",
  "records": [
    {
      "gauge_id": "0",
      "weight": "100000"
    },
    {
      "gauge_id": "1",
      "weight": "1766249"
    },
  ]
}

### external-incentivized-gauges 

Query externally incentivized gauges (gauges distributing rewards on top of the normal OSMO rewards)

```sh
osmosisd query pool-incentives external-incentivized-gauges
```

### gauge-ids                    

Query the gauge ids (by duration) by pool id

```sh
osmosisd query poolincentives gauge-ids [pool-id] [flags]
```

::: details Example

Find out what the gauge IDs are for pool 1:

```bash
osmosisd query poolincentives gauge-ids 1
```

An example output:

```
gauge_ids_with_duration:
- duration: 86400s
  gauge_id: "1"
- duration: 604800s
  gauge_id: "2"
- duration: 1209600s
  gauge_id: "3"
```

In this example, we see that gauge IDs 1,2, and 3 are for the one day, one week, and two week lockup periods respectively for the OSMO/ATOM pool.
