/*
GetSignersAndSignatures retrieves the signers and their respective signatures for either a specific
message (identified by its index) or for all messages in the provided list. The function returns lists
of account addresses and their corresponding signatures.

Parameters:
  - msgs: A list of messages, each potentially having multiple signers.
  - suppliedSignatures: A list of signatures corresponding to the signers of the messages. Each signer
    has exactly one signature, and they appear in the order of the signers in the messages list.
  - feePayer: A string representing the account address of the fee payer. The fee payer is an optional
    additional signer whose signature might be present in the suppliedSignatures list.
  - msgIndex: An integer indicating the index of a specific message for which signers and signatures
    are to be retrieved. If set to -1, the function returns signers and signatures for all messages.

Assumptions:
  - Each signer in the messages list has a unique signature in the suppliedSignatures list. The order
    of signatures matches the order of appearance of the signers.
  - If the fee payer is provided and has not been seen among the signers in the messages, its signature
    is assumed to be the last signature on the list (after the signatures of the other signers from the
    messages).
  - The function assumes that any address conversion from string will succeed for addresses already
    present in the signerToSignature map, as they have been successfully converted before.

Returns:
  - A list of account addresses representing the signers.
  - A list of signatures corresponding to the returned signers.
  - An error, if any occurs during the processing (e.g., invalid fee payer address).

The primary use case for this function is to validate transactions by matching signers with their
signatures. It ensures that all required signers for a specific message or for all messages have
provided valid signatures.
