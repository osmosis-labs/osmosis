* Proto:

NOW:
+ track total number of currently buying accounts (we already track the number of staked tokens)


LBP
+ treasury address
+ should we add a circuit breaker in a pool (in case something bad happens)?

* Functionality

module:
+ DefaultGenesis, genesis import / export
+ ValidateGenesis


Permssions:
+ who can create an LBP?
+ fee - shall there be a bond or a fee?


Check:
+ user can only withdraw his purchased tokens only when the LBP finished
+ seller can finalize and withdraw the income only when the LBP finished
+ maybe rename MsgExit?
+ how should we charge for the initial deposit (the LBP tokens_ou)?


TODO:
+ Limit price when staking
+ LBP stop "button"?
+ ~multiplayer~ should be LBP parameter
