                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the
                            type of the serialized

                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                          message Person {
                            string first_name = 1;
                            string last_name = 2;
                          }

                            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",

                            "lastName": <string>
                          }

                      If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                      representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                      `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                      field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the
                            type of the serialized

                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,

                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                          following:

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)

                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"
                            }

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                        message along with a

                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"
                            }

                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)

                               ...

                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",

                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                          In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                            value in binary format, or produce an error.
                          * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                            URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                            lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                            breaking changes.)

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);

                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                                A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the

                                one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                                `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                                (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                                In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                                expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                                scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                                server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                                * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                                * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                  value in binary format, or produce an error.
                                * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                                  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                  breaking changes.)

                                Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                                protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                                type.googleapis.com.

                                used with implementation specific semantics.

                            The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                            representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                            additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                                package google.profile;
                                message Person {

                            If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                            representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                            `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the
                            type of the serialized

                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                              one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                              the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                              `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                              (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                              In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                              expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                              scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                value in binary format, or produce an error.
                              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                breaking changes.)

                              Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                              type.googleapis.com.


                              Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                              used with implementation specific semantics.

                          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                              Foo foo = ...;
                              Any any;
                              any.PackFrom(foo);
                              ...
                              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                                ...
                              }

                          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                              Foo foo = ...;
                              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                              ...
                              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                              }

                           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                              foo = Foo(...)
                              any = Any()
                              any.Pack(foo)
                              ...
                              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                                any.Unpack(foo)
                                ...

                           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                               any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                               ...
                               foo := &pb.Foo{}
                               if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                                 ...
                               }

                          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                          name "y.z".



                          JSON

                          ====

                          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                              package google.profile;
                              message Person {
                                string first_name = 1;
                                string last_name = 2;
                              }

                              {
                                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                                "firstName": <string>,
                                "lastName": <string>
                              }

                          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                              {
                                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                                "value": "1.212s"

                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the
                            type of the serialized

                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {

                            type of the serialized

                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the
                            type of the serialized

                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)

                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".

                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the
                            type of the serialized

                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the
                            type of the serialized

                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the
                            type of the serialized

                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                            type of the serialized

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                                    A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies
                                    the type of the serialized

                                    protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                                    one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                                    the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                                    `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                                    (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                                    In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                                    expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                                    scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                                    server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                                    * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                                    * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                      value in binary format, or produce an error.
                                    * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                                      URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                      lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                      on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                      breaking changes.)

                                    Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                                    protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                                    type.googleapis.com.


                                    Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                                    used with implementation specific semantics.

                            undelegations without iterating over delegators. When coins are delegated to

                            this validator, the validator is credited with a delegation whose number of

                            bond shares is based on the amount of coins delegated divided by the current

                            exchange rate. Voting power can be calculated as total bonded shares

                            multiplied by exchange rate.

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;

                              ...

                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,

                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {

                                scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                                server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                                * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                                * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                  value in binary format, or produce an error.
                                * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                                  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;

                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the
                            type of the serialized

                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                              "value": "1.212s"

                            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the
                            type of the serialized

                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);

                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]

                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage

                          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                                ...
                              }

                          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                              Foo foo = ...;

                              ...
                              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                              }

                           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                               any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)

                          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                          name "y.z".



                          JSON

                          ====

                          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                              package google.profile;
                              message Person {
                                string first_name = 1;
                                string last_name = 2;
                              }

                              {

                              }

                          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                              {

                          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                            value in binary format, or produce an error.
                          * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                            URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                            lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                            breaking changes.)

                      Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                      of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                      Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                          Foo foo = ...;
                          Any any;
                          any.PackFrom(foo);

                            ...

                      Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                          Foo foo = ...;
                          Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                          ...
                          if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                            foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                          }

                       Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                          foo = Foo(...)
                          any = Any()
                          any.Pack(foo)
                          ...
                          if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                            any.Unpack(foo)
                            ...

                       Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                           foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                           any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)

                             ...
                           }

                      The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                      'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                      methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                      in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                      name "y.z".

                      representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                      additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                          package google.profile;
                          message Person {
                            string first_name = 1;
                            string last_name = 2;
                          }

            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the
            serialized

            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
              value in binary format, or produce an error.
            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
              breaking changes.)

            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

            type.googleapis.com.


            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

            used with implementation specific semantics.

        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along

        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any;
            any.PackFrom(foo);
            ...
            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
              ...
            }

        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
            ...
            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
            }

         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

            foo = Foo(...)
            any = Any()
            any.Pack(foo)
            ...
            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
              any.Unpack(foo)
              ...

         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
             ...
             foo := &pb.Foo{}
             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
               ...
             }

        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

        name "y.z".



        JSON

        ====

        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

            package google.profile;
            message Person {
              string first_name = 1;
              string last_name = 2;
            }

            {
              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
              "firstName": <string>,
              "lastName": <string>
            }

        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

            {
              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
              "value": "1.212s"

                In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                  value in binary format, or produce an error.
                * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                  breaking changes.)

                Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                type.googleapis.com.


                Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                used with implementation specific semantics.

            Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

            of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


            Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                Foo foo = ...;
                Any any;
                any.PackFrom(foo);
                ...
                if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                  ...
                }

            Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                Foo foo = ...;
                Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                ...
                if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                  foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                }

             Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                foo = Foo(...)
                any = Any()
                any.Pack(foo)
                ...
                if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                  any.Unpack(foo)
                  ...

             Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                 foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                 any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                 ...
                 foo := &pb.Foo{}
                 if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                   ...
                 }

            The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

            'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

            methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

            in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

            name "y.z".



            JSON

            ====

            The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

            representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

            additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                package google.profile;
                message Person {
                  string first_name = 1;
                  string last_name = 2;
                }

                {
                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                  "firstName": <string>,
                  "lastName": <string>
                }

            If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

            representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

            `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

            field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                {
                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                  "value": "1.212s"

               Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

        Parameters for changing the weights in a balancer pool smoothly from
        a start weight and end weight over a period of time.
        Currently, the only smooth change supported is linear changing between
        the two weights, but more types may be added in the future.
        When these parameters are set, the weight w(t) for pool time `t` is the
        following:

                protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                  value in binary format, or produce an error.
                * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                  breaking changes.)

                Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                type.googleapis.com.


                Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                used with implementation specific semantics.

                  server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                  * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                  * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]

                    on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage

                  protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

              along with a

              Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

              of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


              Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                  Foo foo = ...;
                  Any any;
                  any.PackFrom(foo);
                  ...
                  if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                    ...
                  }

              Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                  Foo foo = ...;
                  Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                  ...
                  if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                    foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                  }

               Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                  foo = Foo(...)
                  any = Any()
                  any.Pack(foo)
                  ...
                  if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                    any.Unpack(foo)
                    ...

               Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                   foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                   any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                   ...
                   foo := &pb.Foo{}
                   if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                     ...
                   }

              The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

              'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

              methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

              in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

              name "y.z".



              JSON

              ====

              The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

              representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

              additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                  package google.profile;
                  message Person {
                    string first_name = 1;
                    string last_name = 2;
                  }

                  {
                    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                    "firstName": <string>,
                    "lastName": <string>
                  }

              If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

              representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

              `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

              field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                  {
                    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                    "value": "1.212s"

            `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
            with a

            URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


            Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

            of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


            Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                Foo foo = ...;
                Any any;
                any.PackFrom(foo);
                ...
                if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                  ...
                }

            Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                Foo foo = ...;
                Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                ...
                if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                  foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                }

             Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                foo = Foo(...)
                any = Any()
                any.Pack(foo)
                ...
                if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                  any.Unpack(foo)
                  ...

             Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                 foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                 any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                 ...
                 foo := &pb.Foo{}
                 if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                   ...
                 }

            The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

            'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

            methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

            in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

            name "y.z".



            JSON

            ====

            The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

            representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

            additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                package google.profile;
                message Person {
                  string first_name = 1;
                  string last_name = 2;
                }

                {
                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                  "firstName": <string>,
                  "lastName": <string>
                }

            If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

            representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

            `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

            field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                {
                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                  "value": "1.212s"

                    one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                    the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                    `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                    (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                    In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                    expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                    scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                    server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                    * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                    * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                      value in binary format, or produce an error.
                    * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                      URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                      lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                      on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                      breaking changes.)

                    Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                    protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                    type.googleapis.com.


                    Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                    used with implementation specific semantics.

                Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any;
                    any.PackFrom(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                      ...
                    }

                Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                      foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                    }

                 Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                    foo = Foo(...)
                    any = Any()
                    any.Pack(foo)
                    ...
                    if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                      any.Unpack(foo)
                      ...

                 Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                     foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                     any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                     ...
                     foo := &pb.Foo{}
                     if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                       ...
                     }

                The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                name "y.z".



                JSON

                ====

                The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                    package google.profile;
                    message Person {
                      string first_name = 1;
                      string last_name = 2;
                    }

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                      "firstName": <string>,
                      "lastName": <string>
                    }

                If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                      "value": "1.212s"

                      protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                      one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                      the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                      `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                      (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                      In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                      expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                      scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                      server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                      * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                      * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                        value in binary format, or produce an error.
                      * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                        URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                        lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                        on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                        breaking changes.)

                      Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                      protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                      type.googleapis.com.


                      Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                      used with implementation specific semantics.

                  Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

                  of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


                  Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                      Foo foo = ...;
                      Any any;
                      any.PackFrom(foo);
                      ...
                      if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                        ...
                      }

                  Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                      Foo foo = ...;
                      Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                      ...
                      if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                        foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                      }

                   Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                      foo = Foo(...)
                      any = Any()
                      any.Pack(foo)
                      ...
                      if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                        any.Unpack(foo)
                        ...

                   Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                       foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                       any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                       ...
                       foo := &pb.Foo{}
                       if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                         ...
                       }

                  The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

                  'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

                  methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

                  in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                  name "y.z".



                  JSON

                  ====

                  The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                  representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                  additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                      package google.profile;
                      message Person {
                        string first_name = 1;
                        string last_name = 2;
                      }

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                        "firstName": <string>,
                        "lastName": <string>
                      }

                  If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                  representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

                  `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                  field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                      {

                      A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                      the serialized

                      protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                      one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                      the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                      `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                      (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                      In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                      expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                      scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                      server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                      * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                      * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                        value in binary format, or produce an error.
                      * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                        URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                        lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                        on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                        breaking changes.)

                      Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                      protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                      type.googleapis.com.


                      Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                      used with implementation specific semantics.

                          A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type
                          of the serialized

                          protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                          one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                          the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                          `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                          (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                          In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                            value in binary format, or produce an error.
                          * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                            URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                            lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                            breaking changes.)

                          Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                          protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                          type.googleapis.com.


                          Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                          used with implementation specific semantics.

                    A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the
                    serialized

                    protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                    one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                    the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                    `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                    (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                    In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                    expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                    scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                    server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                    * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                    * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                      value in binary format, or produce an error.
                    * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                      URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                      lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                      on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                      breaking changes.)

                    Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                    protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                    type.googleapis.com.


                    Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                    used with implementation specific semantics.

                      A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                      the serialized

                      protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                      one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                      the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                      `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                      (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                      In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                      expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                      scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                      server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                      * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                      * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                        value in binary format, or produce an error.
                      * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                        URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                        lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                        on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                        breaking changes.)

                      Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                      protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                      type.googleapis.com.


                      Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                      used with implementation specific semantics.

                protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                  value in binary format, or produce an error.
                * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage

                Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

            `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
            with a

            URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


            Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

            of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


            Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                Foo foo = ...;
                Any any;
                any.PackFrom(foo);
                ...
                if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                  ...
                }

            Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                Foo foo = ...;
                Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                ...
                if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                  foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                }

             Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                foo = Foo(...)
                any = Any()
                any.Pack(foo)
                ...
                if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                  any.Unpack(foo)
                  ...

             Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                 foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                 any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                 ...
                 foo := &pb.Foo{}
                 if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                   ...
                 }

            The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

            'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

            methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

            in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

            name "y.z".



            JSON

            ====

            The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

            representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

            additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                package google.profile;
                message Person {
                  string first_name = 1;
                  string last_name = 2;
                }

                {
                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                  "firstName": <string>,
                  "lastName": <string>
                }

            If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

            representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

            `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

            field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                {
                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                  "value": "1.212s"
                }

                the first BeginBlock method after the upgrade is applied. It is also used

                to detect whether a software version can handle a given upgrade. If no

                upgrade handler with this name has been set in the software, it will be

                assumed that the software is out-of-date when the upgrade Time or Height is

                    one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

                    the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                    `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form

                    (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                    In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they

                    expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the

                    scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

                    server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                    * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                    * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                      value in binary format, or produce an error.
                    * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                      URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                      lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                      on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                      breaking changes.)

                    Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

                    protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

                    type.googleapis.com.


                    Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

                    used with implementation specific semantics.
