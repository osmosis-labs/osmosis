# Osmosis Networks

This repo contains instructions for genesis validators to create genesis staking transactions (gentxs) to start the Osmosis network.

The relevant instructions can be found in [genesis-validators.md](genesis-validators.md)

Further instructions will be added after June 10, the final day to submit gentxs.

osmosis-1 genesis.json is available on ipfs at [QmXRvBT3hgoXwwPqbK6a2sXUuArGM8wPyo1ybskyyUwUxs](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmXRvBT3hgoXwwPqbK6a2sXUuArGM8wPyo1ybskyyUwUxs).

<!-- The repo contains a copy of the cosmos hub-3 state export, so folks can reproduce the Osmosis initial balances in state. -->
