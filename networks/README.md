# Osmosis Networks

This repo contains instructions for genesis validators to create genesis
staking transactions (gentxs) to start the Osmosis network.

The relevant instructions can be found in
[genesis-validators.md](genesis-validators.md)

Further instructions will be added after June 10, the final day to
submit gentxs.

osmosis-1 genesis.json is available on ipfs at
