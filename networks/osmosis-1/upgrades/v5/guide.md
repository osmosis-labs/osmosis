# Memory Requirements

For this upgrade we're expecting that nodes will need 32GB of total memory available. This can be a combination of RAM and Swap, though RAM is preferred for speed. If you cannot acquire 32GB of RAM, 16GB of RAM and 16GB of Swap should suffice.

Short version swap setup instructions:
```
sudo fallocate -l 16G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
```

# GO Version
Please note, Osmosis `v5.0.0` requires go version `1.17`, if you run `go version` and it says `1.16.x` you should uninstall go and update to `1.17`.
The easiest way to do this is with these scriptshttps://github.com/canha/golang-tools-install-script

To uninstall run:

```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/canha/golang-tools-install-script/master/goinstall.sh | bash -s -- --remove```

Followed this to reinstall the latest `1.17.x` version:

```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/canha/golang-tools-install-script/master/goinstall.sh | bash```

# Install and setup Cosmovisor

We highly recommend validators use cosmovisor to run their nodes. This will make low-downtime upgrades smoother,
as validators don't have to manually upgrade binaries during the upgrade, and instead can preinstall new binaries, and
cosmovisor will automatically update them based on on-chain SoftwareUpgrade proposals.

You should review the docs for cosmovisor located here: https://docs.cosmos.network/master/run-node/cosmovisor.html

If you choose to use cosmovisor, please continue with these instructions:

To install Cosmovisor:

```
git clone https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk
cd cosmos-sdk
git checkout v0.42.9
make cosmovisor
cp cosmovisor/cosmovisor $GOPATH/bin/cosmovisor
cd $HOME
```

After this, you must make the necessary folders for cosmosvisor in your daemon home directory (~/.osmosisd).

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.osmosisd
mkdir -p ~/.osmosisd/cosmovisor
mkdir -p ~/.osmosisd/cosmovisor/genesis
mkdir -p ~/.osmosisd/cosmovisor/genesis/bin
mkdir -p ~/.osmosisd/cosmovisor/upgrades
```

Cosmovisor requires some ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES be set in order to function properly.  We recommend setting these in
your `.profile` so it is automatically set in every session.

For validators we recommmend setting
- `DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=false` for security reasons
- `DAEMON_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE=512` to avoid a bug with extra long log lines crashing the server.
- `DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true` for unattended upgrades

```
echo "# Setup Cosmovisor" >> ~/.profile
echo "export DAEMON_NAME=osmosisd" >> ~/.profile
echo "export DAEMON_HOME=$HOME/.osmosisd" >> ~/.profile
echo "export DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=false" >> ~/.profile
echo "export DAEMON_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE=512" >> ~/.profile
echo "export DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true" >> ~/.profile
echo "export UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true" >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
```
You may leave out `UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true`, however the backup takes a decent amount of time and public snapshots of old states are available.

Finally, you should copy the current osmosisd binary into the cosmovisor/genesis folder.
```
cp $GOPATH/bin/osmosisd ~/.osmosisd/cosmovisor/genesis/bin
```


## Prepare for upgrade (v5)

To prepare for the upgrade, you need to create some folders, and build and install the new binary.

```
mkdir -p ~/.osmosisd/cosmovisor/upgrades/v5/bin
git clone https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis
cd osmosis
git checkout v5.0.0
make build
cp build/osmosisd ~/.osmosisd/cosmovisor/upgrades/v5/bin
```

Now cosmovisor will run with the current binary, and will automatically upgrade to this new binary at the appropriate height if run with:
```
cosmovisor start
```

Please note, this does not automatically update your `$GOPATH/bin/osmosisd` binary, to do that after the upgrade, please run `make install` in the osmosis source folder.
