# v6 to v7 Upgrade Guide


## Memory Requirements

For this upgrade, nodes will need a total of 64GB of memory. This must consist of a **minimum** of 32GB of RAM, while the remaining 32GB can be swap. For best results, use 64GB of physical memory.


Short version swap setup instructions:
```sh
sudo swapoff -a
sudo fallocate -l 32G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
```

To persist swap after restart:
```sh
sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

## Install and setup Cosmovisor

We highly recommend validators use cosmovisor to run their nodes. This will make low-downtime upgrades smoother, as validators don't have to manually upgrade binaries during the upgrade, and instead can pre-install new binaries, and cosmovisor will automatically update them based on on-chain SoftwareUpgrade proposals.

You should review the docs for cosmovisor located here: https://docs.cosmos.network/master/run-node/cosmovisor.html

If you choose to use cosmovisor, please continue with these instructions:

To install Cosmovisor:

```sh
go install github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/cosmovisor/cmd/cosmovisor@v1.0.0
```

After this, you must make the necessary folders for cosmosvisor in your daemon home directory (~/.osmosisd).

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.osmosisd
mkdir -p ~/.osmosisd/cosmovisor
mkdir -p ~/.osmosisd/cosmovisor/genesis
mkdir -p ~/.osmosisd/cosmovisor/genesis/bin
mkdir -p ~/.osmosisd/cosmovisor/upgrades
```

Cosmovisor requires some ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES be set in order to function properly.  We recommend setting these in your `.profile` so it is automatically set in every session.

For validators we recommmend setting
- `DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=false` for security reasons
- `DAEMON_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE=512` to avoid a bug with extra long log lines crashing the server.
- `DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true` for unattended upgrades

```
echo "# Setup Cosmovisor" >> ~/.profile
echo "export DAEMON_NAME=osmosisd" >> ~/.profile
echo "export DAEMON_HOME=$HOME/.osmosisd" >> ~/.profile
echo "export DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=false" >> ~/.profile
echo "export DAEMON_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE=512" >> ~/.profile
echo "export DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true" >> ~/.profile
echo "export UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true" >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
```
You may leave out `UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true`, however the backup takes a decent amount of time and public snapshots of old states are available.

Finally, you should copy the current osmosisd binary into the cosmovisor/genesis folder.
```
cp $GOPATH/bin/osmosisd ~/.osmosisd/cosmovisor/genesis/bin
```


## Prepare for upgrade (v7)

To prepare for the upgrade, you need to create some folders, and build and install the new binary.

```
mkdir -p ~/.osmosisd/cosmovisor/upgrades/v7/bin
cd $HOME/osmosis
git pull
git checkout v7.0.2
make build
cp build/osmosisd ~/.osmosisd/cosmovisor/upgrades/v7/bin
```

Now cosmovisor will run with the current binary, and will automatically upgrade to this new binary at the appropriate height if run with:
```
cosmovisor start
```

Please note, this does not automatically update your `$GOPATH/bin/osmosisd` binary, to do that after the upgrade, please run `make install` in the osmosis source folder.
