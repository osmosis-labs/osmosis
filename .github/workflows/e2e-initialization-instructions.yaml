            **Important Notice**

            This PR includes modifications to the `tests/e2e/initialization` module.
            Please follow the instructions below:

            1. Backport these changes to the previous Osmosis version's branch.
            2. Run the script inside a Docker container to update genesis and configs for pre-upgrade Osmosis.
            3. Merge the backported changes.
            4. The image will be built and uploaded to Docker Hub [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/osmolabs/osmosis-e2e-init-chain/tags).
            5. Grab the latest image and update it in the PR to the main branch replacing the `previousVersionInitTag` in the `osmosis/tests/e2e/containers/config.go`

            Please let us know if you need any help.
