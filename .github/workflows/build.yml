# This workflow builds the osmosisd binary for amd64 and arm64 on Darwin and Linux.
#
# This workflow runs:
# - on pushes to main
# - on every pull requests
# - when manually triggered
#
# Caching strategy
# This code will store the Go modules cache based on the hash of your go.sum file,
# ensuring that the cache will be invalidated when your dependencies change.
# The cache will be stored on a per-branch basis, which should prevent cache pollution issues between different branches.
