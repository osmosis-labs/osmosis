# This is a scheduled workflow that runs on the 1st and 15th day of every month at 00:00 UTC and can also be triggered manually.
# To run locally one could use the following command:
#   act workflow_dispatch -j update-asset-lists --secret-file .env --input source-branch=7859
#
# Workflow does the following when triggered:
# - Runs a script to update asset lists.
# - Commits and pushes changes to the source-branch ( default: main ).
# - Opens a PR from the source branch to the target-branch ( default: main ).
#
# PR is created using DEFAULT strategy of peter-evans/create-pull-request action:
# - If there are changes in the source branch, a PR is created.
# - If there are no changes in the source branch, no PR is created.
# - If there is an existing PR from the source branch to the target branch, it is updated.
# - If there is an existing PR from the source branch to the target branch, and there are no changes in the source branch, the PR is closed.
