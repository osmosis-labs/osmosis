            **Important Notice**

            This PR modifies an in-repo Go module. It is one of:
            - osmomath
            - osmoutils
            - x/ibc-hooks
            - x/epochs

            The dependent Go modules, especially the root one, will have to be
            updated to reflect the changes. Failing to do so might cause e2e to fail.

            Please follow the instructions below:

            1. Open https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/actions/workflows/go-mod-auto-bump.yml
            2. Provide the current branch name
            3. On success, confirm if an automated commit corretly updated the go.mod and go.sum files

            Please let us know if you need any help.
