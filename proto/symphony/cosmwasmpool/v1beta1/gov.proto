// MigratePoolContractsProposal is a gov Content type for

// whitelist if needed. It has two options to perform the migration:
//
// 1. If the codeID is non-zero, it will migrate the pool contracts to a given
// codeID assuming that it has already been uploaded. uploadByteCode must be
// empty in such a case. Fails if codeID does not exist. Fails if uploadByteCode
// is not empty.
//
// 2. If the codeID is zero, it will upload the given uploadByteCode and use the
// new resulting code id to migrate the pool to. Errors if uploadByteCode is
// empty or invalid.
//
// In both cases, if one of the pools specified by the given poolID does not
// exist, the proposal fails.
//
// The reason for having poolIDs be a slice of ids is to account for the
// potential need for emergency migration of all old code ids associated with
// particular pools to new code ids, or simply having the flexibility of
// migrating multiple older pool contracts to a new one at once when there is a
// release.
//
// poolD count to be submitted at once is gated by a governance paramets (20 at
// launch). The proposal fails if more. Note that 20 was chosen arbitrarily to
// have a constant bound on the number of pools migrated at once. This size will
// be configured by a module parameter so it can be changed by a constant.
